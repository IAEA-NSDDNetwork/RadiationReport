# RadiationReport-test
RadiationReport is Java code to calculate energies and intensities of all radiations as well as logft for a decay dataset. It is an alternative to the 
RADLIST and LOGFT Fortran codes combined. It can calculate logft values for forbidden-unique decays with order>2 which are calculated incorrectly as allowed 
decays by the LOGFT code.

# AlphaHF-test
AlphaHF is a Java code to calculate Hindrance Factor and nuclear radius parameter R0 for alpha decay. It is intended to replace the ALPHAD_RADD, ALPHAD, and RADD fortran codes. AlphaHF is part of the [ENSDF Analysis and Utility Programs](https://nds.iaea.org/public/ensdf_pgm/).
